// How many ways can you make the sum of a number?
// From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)#

// In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. If order matters, the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

function sum(num) {
  //find out and return the number of ways you can get the sum of the number of passed in.
  let waysToSum = 0

  return waysToSum
}

console.log(sum(4)) //should return 5
// 1 + 3 = 4
// 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
// 2 + 2 = 4
// 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
// 4 = 4
